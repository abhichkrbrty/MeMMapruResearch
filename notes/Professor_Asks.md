# Questions for Faculty Guidance

## Research Direction
- Does MemMapRu make sense as a research instrument rather than a product?
- Is the framing aligned with HCI / AI trust / user agency research?
- What aspects should be simplified or removed for an academic study?

## Study & Survey Design
- What types of surveys would be appropriate for this system?
  - Pre- vs post-interaction
  - Qualitative vs quantitative
- Is a pilot study feasible without formal IRB?
- What would be a reasonable sample size for an early study?

## Ethics & IRB
- At what stage would IRB approval be required?
- Are observational or opt-in studies exempt initially?
- How should memory data be framed ethically?

## Cross-Department Collaboration
- Would collaboration with the MBA or UX programs make sense?
- Who typically coordinates cross-department research or user studies?
- Are there existing participant pools or processes to leverage?

## Next Steps
- What would you recommend as the next academic milestone for this work?
